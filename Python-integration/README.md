# SAS Viya and Python Integration for Machine Learning

## Overview

SAS integrates with Python through various code libraries and tools that allow open source developers to unite the Python language with the analytic power of SAS.  This helps ensure that organizations have the tools available for all parts of your analytics journey, from data to discovery, and deployment. This folder features various files focused on integrating Python and SAS Viya for machine learning.

## Notebooks

* [The Python & Viya Workshop](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-viya-machine-learning/blob/master/Python-integration/Python_Viya_Workshop.ipynb) notebook is a great place those new to Python or CAS. This notebook starts with an introduction to Pandas, moves to an introduction to CAS and SWAT, discussing running actions in CAS and accessing data in CAS, and ends by building analytical models.
* [The Data Science Pilot Action Set](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-viya-machine-learning/blob/master/Python-integration/The%20Data%20Science%20Pilot%20Action%20Set.ipynb) notebook discusses how to use the Data Science Pilot Action Set for automated machine learning. This notebook discusses the available actions around data set exploration, feature engineering and selection, and automated machine learning.
* [The Viya 2020 Example](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-viya-machine-learning/blob/master/Python-integration/Viya%202020%20Example.ipynb) notebook builds an automated machine learning model using SAS Data Science Pilot via the SWAT package and a Python model pipeline using xgboost and registers both models and metadata into model manager using the sasctl and pzmm package.
