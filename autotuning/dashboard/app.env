# Autotune web-app environment variables. Used by the RestAF server to         #

#
# APPNAME - the name you want the user to use to invoke it
#           Also all the artifacts of your application will be in public/APPNAME directory
#           For example if APPNAME is autotune then public/autotune will have all the files
#           associated with your app.
#
APPNAME=autotune

#
# location of the application resources(html, shared resources etc...)
# each APPNAME corresponds to a directory in this location
# if current directory then set APPLOC to .
#
APPLOC=./build

#
# entry point of the app
#
APPENTRY=index.html

#
# The host name of the web-app server.
# Use "localhost" if you access the app on your local machine only.
# Use the actual network name (or IP address) of the machine if you want to access the app
# from other machines.
# The app can be installed and executed from the same machine as your Viya server. It will
# use a different port number (specified below).
#
# for localhost
#APPHOST=localhost
# for viya353
APPHOST=viya353.na.sas.com

#
# The port on which this app is expected to run.
# For example, if APPNAME=autotune, APPHOST=localhost, and APPPORT=5001,
# the web-app access URL will be "http://localhost:5001/autotune"
# If APPNAME=autotune, APPHOST=viya353.na.sas.com, and APPPORT=5001,
# the web-app access URL will be "http://viya353.na.sas.com:5001/autotune"
#
APPPORT=5001

#
# The URL of the Viya server that your app will be connecting to for authorization,
# accessing the Autotune history data, creating and displaying a VA report.
#
VIYA_SERVER=http://viya353.na.sas.com

#
# Authentication type.
# RestAF will use this for authenticating with the Viya server.
# Do not change this.
#
AUTHFLOW=code

#
# A unique client name and passcode ("secret") for identifying the app client with the Viya server
#
# for localhost
#CLIENTID=appc
#CLIENTSECRET=secret
# for viya353
CLIENTID=autotune
CLIENTSECRET=autotune

#
# These values will be used as the default CASLIB and
# DATA TABLE name by the app.
# Change them as desired, if you have a specific CASLIB
# and a specific DATA TABLE name that you usually use when
# you open the app. These names are NOT case-sensitive.
#
WORK_LIB_NAME=PUBLIC
DATA_TABLE_NAME=GB_IMAGEUCI_HISTORY_9_PARMS

#
# These names determine the location (folder) and the report name that the app
# will use for the temporary VA Report that it creates for monitoring
# the Autotune results. This temporary report is overwritten every time the
# app loads a new  Autotune history data table. The folder must be at the
# root (top) level. These names ARE case-sensitive.
